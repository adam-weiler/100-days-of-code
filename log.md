# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Studied the basics of JavaScript using the freeCodeCamp lessons.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I have a good grasp on basic JavaScript. It's the complicated JS that I need to spend more time studying.



### Day 2: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went to a meetup to learn about Promises. Continued studying the basics of JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Promises are something new to me, and it was good to learn in a group setting. The presenter was a very good speaker made a demonstration to explain the concept better.  I am nearly finished the Basic JavaScript unit as well.



### Day 3: February 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started the ES6 section of JavaScript using the freeCodeCamp lessons. Finished the Robofriends tutorial from the Zero to Mastery course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** The first time I studied this section I had a lot of trouble understanding ES6. I think I understand most of it, but Destructuring is a weak spot I need to work on. The RoboFriends tutorial is a great way to see how a React app is built.

### Day 4: February 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the ES6 section. Starting working on the Pomodoro Clock project for the Front-End Libraries Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I know future lessons will refer back to the new ES6 techniques, so I really want to get a firm handle on them. Some of it is syntax, and some is new features. I also started working on my Pomodoro Clock and got the buttons working.
